Hello there, this is a collection of data science and data analytics projects created! 

COVID Data Analysis:
This repository contains an analysis of COVID data obtained from ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. The analysis was performed using SQL queries and the following skills were employed: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, and Creating Views.
The analysis focused on exploring various aspects of the COVID pandemic, including the percentage of population that contracted COVID, percentage death rate, countries with the highest infection rates, countries with the highest percentage of deaths and highest death counts, and grouping data by continents with the highest death counts and global numbers. In addition, a rolling count was created that adds up the total number of people vaccinated daily, and the total percentage of population vaccinated was calculated.

Data visualization was done on Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lena.chen2238/viz/CovidData_16743832113750/Dashboard1?publish=yes
